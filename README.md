# Digital-Twin-based-Beam-Training-via-Reinforcement-Learning-with-Raytracing



A method of simulating Beam Training in a realistic environment in Blender. Multiple different reinforcement agents trained in this environment. They successfully learned to keep a connection between a simulated pencil beam antenna and a moving target.
